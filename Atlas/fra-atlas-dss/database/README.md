# FRA Atlas and DSS Database Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the SQL scripts and documentation necessary for setting up and managing the PostgreSQL database used in the FRA Atlas and Decision Support System (DSS) project. The database is designed to store and manage data related to the Forest Rights Act (FRA) claims, asset mapping, and recommendations generated by the DSS.

## Files

- **init.sql**: This script initializes the PostgreSQL database schema, creating the necessary tables and relationships to support the application.
  
- **demo_fra_claims.sql**: This script populates the database with dummy data for FRA claims, allowing for testing and demonstration of the application.

## Database Setup Instructions

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. **Create a Database**: Create a new database for the FRA Atlas and DSS project. You can do this using the following command in the PostgreSQL command line:
   ```
   CREATE DATABASE fra_atlas_dss;
   ```

3. **Run Initialization Script**: Execute the `init.sql` script to set up the database schema. You can run the script using the following command:
   ```
   psql -U your_username -d fra_atlas_dss -f path/to/init.sql
   ```

4. **Populate with Dummy Data**: After initializing the schema, run the `demo_fra_claims.sql` script to insert dummy data into the database:
   ```
   psql -U your_username -d fra_atlas_dss -f path/to/demo_fra_claims.sql
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**: You can verify that the tables have been created and populated correctly by connecting to the database and running some queries.

## Usage

The database will be accessed by the backend Node.js application to perform CRUD operations on FRA claims, asset data, and recommendations. Ensure that the database connection details are correctly configured in the backend application to enable seamless integration.

## Additional Resources

For more information on how the database interacts with the rest of the application, refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory, particularly the `workflow.md` and `system_explanation.md` files.
