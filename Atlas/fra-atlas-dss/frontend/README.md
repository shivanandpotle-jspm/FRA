# FRA Atlas and Decision Support System (DSS) - Frontend Documentation

## Overview
The FRA Atlas and Decision Support System (DSS) is a web-based application designed to facilitate the integrated monitoring of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) implementation. This project leverages AI-powered data digitization, WebGIS technologies, and machine learning to provide insights and recommendations for stakeholders involved in FRA claims and asset management.

## Objectives
- To digitize and process FRA documents using OCR and NLP techniques.
- To create an interactive WebGIS-based FRA Atlas for visualizing claims and related spatial data.
- To implement AI-based asset mapping for land use classification.
- To develop a Decision Support System that provides actionable recommendations based on data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fra-atlas-dss.git
   cd fra-atlas-dss/frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Folder Structure
- **public/**: Contains static files such as `index.html`.
- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **components/**: React components for different functionalities.
  - **assets/**: Contains demo shapefiles and satellite tiles for testing.
  - **data/**: Contains demo datasets in JSON format.

### Key Components
- **MapView.js**: Renders the interactive map using Mapbox or Leaflet.
- **Filters.js**: Provides filtering options for the displayed data.
- **ProgressTracker.js**: Displays the progress of FRA claims.
- **DSSRecommendations.js**: Shows recommendations generated by the DSS.

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can:
- View and interact with the FRA claim areas on the map.
- Apply filters to narrow down the displayed data based on state, district, village, and tribal group.
- Track the progress of FRA claims and view recommendations for beneficiaries.
